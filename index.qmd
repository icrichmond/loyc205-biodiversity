## Today's Learning Goals

::: incremental
-   Define and give an example of Nature's Contributions to People
-   Describe how the impacts of the Emerald Ash Borer in Canadian cities are connected to urban biodiversity
-   Argue why urban biodiversity is important with at least 2 lines of reasoning
:::

::: notes
-   just out of curiosity, who here heard of the emerald ash borer? from other classes or from interacting with it outside of school?
:::

## Urban Biodiversity

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   What is biodiversity?

    -   Species richness

    -   Evenness

    -   Functional

-   Increased biodiversity at one trophic level provides opportunity for increased biodiversity at the next

    -   With some exceptions

::: notes
-   lets start with urban biodiversity
-   biodiversity actually isn't just one thing, which i think you may have discussed in this class recently
-   when we are talking about urban biodiversity, we are of course talking about biodiversity in an urban setting
-   in urban settings, we are usually talking about 1 of 3 types of biodiversity
-   species richness, the total count of different species in a particular group
-   evenness, the count and distribution of different species
-   functional diversity: this is really important in cities. this is not necessarily different species or genera but exactly how it sounds - groups that function differently
    -   these groupings depend on what you are interested in
    -   e.g., urban trees ( i am a tree scientist)

## Nature's Contributions to People

-   **All the contributions of living nature to people's quality of life**
-   Culturally dependent and often context-specific
-   Built on the framework of "ecosystem services"

![[Díaz et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aap8826)](imgs/science.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

::: notes

- another main concept of this lecture is nature's contributions to people 
- defined as "all the contributions of living nature to people's quality of life" 
- in the literature discussing nature's contributions, a theme that comes up is that they are culturally dependent and context-specific. 
- if we think through that with an example, we can imagine how fall leaves are an important contribution from nature that we receive in the fall - they make us happy, it is a cultural touchstone, there are many associated recreational and cultural activities, and all of these are dependent on culture and context

## Nature's Contributions to People

![[Frontiers for Young Minds](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2020.00098)](imgs/ncp.jpg)

::: notes

- we often categorize nature's contributions to people as material, non-material, or regulating 
- we can go over definitions and examples more after but i want to hear what you think of when we talk about these things 

:::



## Paired Discussion (3 minutes)

-   What are examples of material, non-material, and regulating contributions from nature in your lives?
-   Are they context specific/culturally dependent?

::: notes
- material example: food, lumber
- non-material examples: happiness, health, experiences, inspiration, learning 
- regulating: temperature, pollination, ecosystem functioning

## Nature's Contributions in Cities

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   80% of Quebecers and Canadians live in cities
-   Our relationship with nature is urban
-   We experience positive and negative contributions
    -   e.g., Temperature regulation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: notes
- specifically this lecture is about cities and the importance of urban biodiversity 
- when we think about nature's contributions to people ,sometimes we are imagining national parks or nature that is outside of cities 
- but 80% of Quebecers and Canadians live in cities, which means that the first experience with nature that many of us have and the most common interaction w nature we have , is in an urban environment 
- its important to note that nature's contributions can be both positive and negative, its not helpful to erase the complexity of our relationship with nature 
- this is a VERY trendy one right now, that some of you may think about in your regular lives/hear about on the radio/etc but temperature regulation by vegetation and specifically trees in our cities is really important for our wellbeing 
- its not necessarily a simple relationship, trees have negative effects as well but the contributions of trees and vegetation to cooling are really critical for a lot of people 

:::

## Data Exploration (7 minutes)

-   Visit this site: <https://shorturl.at/ueCcT>
-   What does the data say about your neighbourhood (or the neighbourhoods of people you know)?
-   Are temperature mitigation/vegetation abundance aspects of your neighbourhood that you have thought about before?


:::

- we are now going to take a few minutes to explore some neighbourhoods and the cooling effect we experience

## Biodiversity as one of Nature's Contributions to People

::: incremental
-   **Question:** Does biodiversity itself contribute to urban residents' quality of life? How so?
-   For **many** types of contributions, increasing biodiversity may **increase** overall capacity
-   For **individual** types of contributions, biodiversity may actually **decrease** capacity
    -   E.g., maximizing temperature regulation
:::


::: notes
- ok so now that we have been thinking of what nature's contributions to people are for a few minutes, do we think that biodiversity itself is one of them? 
- bit of a trick question - still controversial

::: notes
- in this scenario, biodiversity would most likely decrease the ability to regulate temperature 
:::

## Biodiversity as Resilience

-   Biodiversity makes our ecosystems more resilient, protecting nature's contributions to people

::: notes
- a really critical contribution of biodiversity is resilience

**The loss of (many of) Montréal's ash trees**

-   20% of Montréal's public trees were ash (poor biodiversity)
-   The introduction of the emerald ash borer resulted in a loss of 40,000+ trees, canopy cover, and millions of dollars
-   Lack of biodiversity left our city vulnerable and lacking resilience

::: notes
- Canadian cities have not always been good at planting biodiverse forests, for a variety of reasons 
- the vulnerability we face without biodiversity has become extremely clear when confronting the emerald ash borer

-   Cities are uniquely susceptible to invasive species
-   The loss of ash trees provided gaps in canopy that allowed invasive species to come in

::: notes
- in addition to having less temperature regulation, habitat, greenness, all the benefits you can think of, the loss of ash trees has presented a huge management problem wrt invasive species 
- for many many reasons, cities are uniquely susceptible to invasive species 
- as we are seeing the loss of ash trees, we are seeing the influx of invasive species taking up that "empty space" 
:::


## Small Group Discussion (5 minutes)

-   Given that there is mass loss of trees, loss of canopy, and an increase in invasive species due to the emerald ash borer, what is a recommendation you would give to a city manager trying to replant the urban forest?


::: notes
- essentially, the city is in a situation where they have many competing interests for what contributions public trees provide: temperature regulation, food provision, aesthetics, they have a harsh environment where not as many species can survive, there is a mass die-off of trees due to monoculture planting, and the canopy gaps are allowing invasive plants to take over 

- what is a recommendation you would give to a city manager trying to replant right now?

## Biodiversity as Inequity

![[Aznarez et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42949-023-00128-7)](imgs/luxury.webp)

::: notes
- the last thing we need to talk about here is how biodiversity is experienced and managed in our cities 
- there's a clear trend in North American cities where areas with whiter, richer, more highly educated residents have more biodiversity (trees, birds, vegetation)
:::

## Biodiversity as Inequity

-   There is a global trend called **"The Luxury Effect"**
-   Urban biodiversity increases in neighbourhoods composed of wealthy, white, educated people
-   This form of environmental injustice leaves marginalized populations with fewer of nature's contributions and the less resilience to disturbance

> The equal distribution of biodiversity in cities, and thus the elimination of the luxury effect, is a worthy societal goal. ([Leong et al., 2018](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0082))

::: notes
- the luxury effect comes to fruition in many different ways: wealthier people have larger property, more money to buy vegetation, greening causes gentrification, more advocacy for public spaces
- but the end result is the same: marginalized people suffer

    -   The impact was large because of lack of biodiversity

-   Urban biodiversity contributes to our lives

    -   Increasing nature's contributions to people
