## Today's Learning Goals

-   Define and give an example of Nature's Contributions to People
-   Describe how the impacts of the Emerald Ash Borer in Canadian cities are connected to urban biodiversity
-   Argue why urban biodiversity is important with two or more lines of reasoning

## Urban Biodiversity

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   What is biodiversity?

    -   Species richness

    -   Evenness

    -   Functional

-   Increased biodiversity at one trophic level provides opportunity for increased biodiversity at the next

    -   With some exceptions

## Nature's Contributions to People[^1]

[^1]: DÃ­az et al., 2018, Science, [doi: 10.1126/science.aap8826](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aap8826)

-   All the contributions of living nature to people's quality of life
-   Culturally dependent and often context-specific
-   Built on the framework of "ecosystem services

## Nature's Contributions to People

::: notes
ask for examples of material, non-material, and regulating contributions in their lives - can we extend to the idea of context specific contributions?

## Nature's Contributions in Cities

-   80% of Quebecers (and Canadians) live in cities
-   The majority of our interactions with nature happen in cities
-   We experience positive and negative contributions
    -   One example is [temperature regulation by trees](https://shorturl.at/ueCcT)
    -   <https://shorturl.at/ueCcT>

## Biodiversity as a Contribution

-   Is biodiversity contributing to urban residents' quality of life? How so?

-   

::: notes
if we are trying to increase or maximize one single contribution, often more biodiversity doesn't necessarily help with this.

there are often specific species that contribute most to a specific set of contributions

## Maximizing Temperature Regulation

## Resilience of Urban Nature

## The loss of ash trees

## Inequity in effects

## Invasive take-over
