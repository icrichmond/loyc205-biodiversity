## Today's Learning Goals

::: incremental
-   Define and give an example of Nature's Contributions to People
-   Describe how the impacts of the Emerald Ash Borer in Canadian cities are connected to urban biodiversity
-   Argue why urban biodiversity is important with at least 2 lines of reasoning
:::

## Urban Biodiversity

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   What is biodiversity?

    -   Species richness

    -   Evenness

    -   Functional

-   Increased biodiversity at one trophic level provides opportunity for increased biodiversity at the next

    -   With some exceptions

## Nature's Contributions to People

-   **All the contributions of living nature to people's quality of life**
-   Culturally dependent and often context-specific
-   Built on the framework of "ecosystem services"

## Nature's Contributions to People

![[Frontiers for Young Minds](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2020.00098)](imgs/ncp.jpg)

## Paired Discussion (3 minutes)

-   What are examples of material, non-material, and regulating contributions from nature in your lives?
-   Are they context specific/culturally dependent?

## Nature's Contributions in Cities

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   80% of Quebecers and Canadians live in cities
-   Our relationship with nature is urban
-   We experience positive and negative contributions
    -   e.g., Temperature regulation

## Data Exploration (7 minutes)

-   Visit this site: <https://shorturl.at/ueCcT>
-   What does the data say about your neighbourhood (or the neighbourhoods of people you know)?
-   Are temperature mitigation/vegetation abundance aspects of your neighbourhood that you have thought about before?

## Biodiversity as one of Nature's Contributions to People

::: incremental
-   **Question:** Does biodiversity itself contribute to urban residents' quality of life? How so?
-   For **many** types of contributions, increasing biodiversity may **increase** overall capacity
-   For **individual** types of contributions, biodiversity may actually **decrease** capacity
    -   E.g., maximizing temperature regulation

## Biodiversity as Resilience

-   Biodiversity makes our ecosystems more resilient, protecting nature's contributions to people

**The loss of (many of) Montréal's ash trees**

-   20% of Montréal's public trees were ash (poor biodiversity)
-   The introduction of the emerald ash borer resulted in a loss of 40,000+ trees, canopy cover, and millions of dollars
-   Lack of biodiversity left our city vulnerable and lacking resilience

-   Cities are uniquely susceptible to invasive species
-   The loss of ash trees provided gaps in canopy that allowed invasive species to come in

## Small Group Discussion (5 minutes)

-   Given that there is mass loss of trees, loss of canopy, and an increase in invasive species due to the emerald ash borer, what is a recommendation you would give to a city manager trying to replant the urban forest?

## Biodiversity as Inequity

**Take-aways**

-   Nature's contributions to people are ways in which living nature influences human quality of life

-   The emerald ash borer has had significant impacts on Montréal's urban forest and its residents

    -   The impact was large because of lack of biodiversity

-   Urban biodiversity contributes to our lives

    -   Increasing nature's contributions to people

    -   Improving our ecosystem's resilience
